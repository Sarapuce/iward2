# IWard2

## Disclaimer : 

This is a side project ot learn how to reverse a mobile app. I won't use it since I have a job and don't care about 30â‚¬ vouchers. If you are part of the WW team and want me to hide this project, don't hesitate to contact me at alexandre.herve97@gmail.com

## Usage :

### Docker container :

1. Build the container `docker build . -t iward:2`
2. Run it by exposing the 8000 port, presising the path of the database and mounting the volumes `docker run -e DBPATH=/db/db.sqlite3 -e PASSWORD=pass -v /path/to/db.sqlite3:/db/ -p 8000:8000 iward:2`
3. Connect in your favorite browser in http://localhost:8000

### local :

1. [Install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
2. Install poetry dependencies `poetry install`
3. Start a poetry shell `poetry shell`
4. Start the uvicorn server `cd iward2` and `uvicorn main:app --reload`
5. Connect in your favorite browser in http://localhost:8000

## How does it works ?

1. Log in to the app with the password set in env variable. The default one is `password` (I should use a hash but I'm lazy)
2. Input the email you want to use in the first field
3. Copy the link in your email address and paste it in the second field
4. You should have an interface which shows you how much ward you have
